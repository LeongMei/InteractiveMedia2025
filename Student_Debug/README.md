## STUDENT DEBUGGING - A PLACE TO SHARE P5.JS SKETCHES FOR CODE SUPPORT.
Debugged files will be shared here for p5.js projects.<br>
Please download your 'debugged' files and integrate these sketches into your Workbook project. <br>

#### TROUBLESHOOTING

### Basics: Sketch files, folders and link paths
> Save and rename your sketch, when you create a new p5 project. <br>
> This will create a sketch folder, that holds your sketch. By default sketch folder are saved to the 'Processing'folder on your device .<br>
> To copy an asset file into your sketch folder, like an image or font, drag the file over the text editor. <br>

### SET UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT IN PROCESSING

<strong> ARE YOU CODING IN P5.JS MODE? </strong> <br>
> Is your Processing App set to p5.js mode? If not, you won't be able to run your sketch. <br>
> If the mode button says 'JAVA' in the top right menu bar, than you are not in the correct mode. You will need to click the 'JAVA' mode button and navigate to the libraries tab to install the p5.js library. <br>

> ###### STEPS - SET MODE TO P5.JS <br>
> 1. Open the Processing app  <br>
> 2. Click on the mode button, on the top right, above the text editor <br>
> 3. The mode button will say  'JAVA' by default <br>
> 4. Select 'manage modes' in the drop-down <br>
> 5. In the Mode tab,  search the filter for ‘p5.js’ <br>
> 6. Select the p5.js and click to install the p5.js library <br>
> 7. When the installation is complete, open a new sketch file. <br>
> 8. Select the mode button again & select p5.js <br>
> 9. Now you a ready to code! Remember to save and rename your sketch <br>

> ###### CHECK YOUR SOFTWARE VERSIONING 
> <strong> Are you running the latest version of Processing -> link here: <https://processing.org/download> </strong> <br>
