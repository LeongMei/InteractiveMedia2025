#### TROUBLESHOOTING

###### SAVE YOUR SKETCH AND CHECK YOUR LINK PATHS
>> Save and rename your sketch, when you create a new p5 project. <br>
>> This will create a sketch folder, that holds your sketch <br>
>> To copy an asset file into your sketch folder, like an image or font, drag the file over the text editor. <br>

##### SET UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT

###### SET THE MODE TO P5.JS <br>
>> Is your Processing App set to p5.js mode? If not, you won't be able to run your sketch. <br>
>> If the mode button says 'JAVA' in the top right menu bar, than you are not in the correct mode. You will need to click the 'JAVA' mode button and navigate to the libraries tab to install the p5.js library. <br>
